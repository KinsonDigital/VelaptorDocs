# Rendering Textures

A game cannot be a game without having the ability to render textures. This guide will show you how to render whole
textures to the screen.

:::note Guide Source Code
Go to the <GuideLink projectName="RenderingTextures" version="v1.0.0-preview.32"/> guide project to see the source code for a fully working example of this guide.
:::


## <span class="color-step">Step 1: Project setup</span>

Create a basic Velaptor application.
:::note Refer To Guide
For more info, refer to the [Project Setup](./project-setup) guide.

## <span class="color-step">Step 2: Rendering a texture</span>

### <span class="color-sub-step">2.1: Create class fields</span>

Create the class fields shown below. These will be used to render the Velaptor mascot texture to the screen.

```csharp
public class Game : Window
{
    private readonly IBatcher batcher; // Used to control batching
    private readonly ITextureRenderer textureRenderer; // Renders textures
    private ILoader<ITexture>? textureLoader; // Used to load textures
    private ITexture? mascotTexture; // The texture to render
    ...
}
```

### <span class="color-sub-step">2.2: Setup window</span>

Add code to the constructor to setup the window to have a title as well as a smaller size.

```csharp
public Game()
{
    Title = "Render Textures"; // Set the title of the window
    Width = 800; // Set the width of the window
    Height = 800; // Set the height of the window
}
```

### <span class="color-sub-step">2.3: Create loader, batcher, & renderer</span>

In the constructor, create the `textureLoader`, `batcher`, and `textureRenderer` objects.
This is done by using various factories that make it easy to create these often used types.

```csharp
public Game()
{
    ...
    this.textureLoader = ContentLoaderFactory.CreateFontLoader();
    this.batcher = RendererFactory.CreateBatcher();
    this.textureRenderer = RendererFactory.CreateTextureRenderer();
}
```


## <span class="color-step">Step 3: Load and unload the content</span>

Loading and unloading content is a very important part of game development.  It is also important to unload the content
when it is not needed or used anymore.  In the next couple of steps, we will setup the loading and unloading of the texture.

### <span class="color-sub-step">3.1: Get the content</span>

Download or create any _**.png**_ file you want.

:::info Velaptor Mascot Image
Click the image below to download the image from GitHub.

<GuideImg 
    guideName="RenderingTextures"
    apiVersion="v1.0.0-preview.32"
    imgFileName="velaptor-mascot.png"
    sizePercentage={10}/>
:::


### <span class="color-sub-step">3.2: Add the content</span>

Add the image to the project and set it as content by following the steps in the [Adding Content](./adding-content) tutorial.

### <span class="color-sub-step">3.3: Load the texture content</span>

Now that our content has been successfully added to the project, we can now move on to loading the texture and rendering it.

We can load the texture by using the `textureLoader`.  There are various loaders available in **Velaptor**
that can be used to load different kinds of content.

To do this, override the `OnLoad()` method and add the following code to load the texture.


```csharp
protected override void OnLoad()
{
    this.mascotTexture = this.textureLoader.Load("velaptor-mascot");

    base.OnLoad();
}
```

### <span class="color-sub-step">3.4: Unload the texture content</span>

Now we can unload the content when the game shuts down.  This is to clean up resources that are no longer needed.
To do this, we can override the `OnUnload()` method.  We can then call the `Unload()` method on the texture loader
and send in the texture object we loaded earlier.  To do this, we need to add the `Velaptor.ExtensionMethods` namespace
to the top of the file to get access to the `Unload()` extension method.

Add the following using statement.

```csharp
...
using Velaptor.ExtensionMethods; // Add this line here
...
public class Game : Window
{
    ...
}
```

Now we can override the `OnUnload()` method and unload the font.

```csharp
protected override void OnUnload()
{
    this.textureLoader.Unload(this.mascotTexture);
    base.OnUnload();
}

```

## <span class="color-step">Step 4: Render the texture</span>

Finally, we can now render our image.  Create the the `OnDraw()` method with the following code to render the texture.

```csharp
protected override void OnDraw(FrameTime frameTime)
{
    IBatcher.Begin();

    var x = (int)(Width / 2); // Center of the window horizontally
    var y = (int)(Height / 2); // Center of the window vertically

    // Render the mascot image in the center of the window
    this.textureRenderer.Render(this.mascotTexture, x, y);

    IBatcher.End();

    base.OnDraw(frameTime);
}
```


## <span class="color-step">Step 5: Run it</span>

Run the application. You should see the result below!!
