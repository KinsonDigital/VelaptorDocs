# Rendering Text

This guide will show you the basics of rendering text to a window using **Velaptor**.

:::note Guide Source Code
Go to the <TutorialLink projectName="RenderingText" version="v1.0.0-preview.28"/> tutorial project to see the source code for a fully working example of this guide.
:::


## <span class="color-step">Step 1: Create project</span>

Create a basic **Velaptor** application.
:::note Refer To Guide
For more info, refer to the [Project Setup](./project-setup) guide.
:::


## <span class="color-step">Step 2: Setup window</span>

Let's start simple and set the window size and title in the `Game` constructor.

```csharp
public Game()
{
    Title = "Render Text Guide";
    Width = 800;
    Height = 800;
}
```


## <span class="color-step">Step 3: Loading content</span>

### <span class="color-sub-step">Step 3.1: Create font field</span>

Create a class field named `font` at the top of the class. This will be the loaded font to use for rendering text.

```csharp
private IFont? font;
```

### <span class="color-sub-step">Step 3.2: Load the font</span>

Now let's load the font using the `ContentLoader` property that belongs to the `Window` class.

```csharp
protected override void OnLoad()
{
    this.font = ContentLoader.LoadFont("TimesNewRoman-Regular", 24); // Loads the font into the class field
    base.OnLoad();
}
```
:::tip content name
The name of the content to load is the same as the content file minus the file extension. You can use or
omit the file extension when using the `ContentLoader.LoadFont()` method. Also, the name is not _**case-sensitive**_.  
Example: The content names _**'my-texture'**_ and _**'My-Texture'**_ are equivalent.
:::

:::caution Warning
Since the name of the content to load is based on the name of the file, renaming the file will break your application!!
:::


## <span class="color-step">Step 4: Rendering text</span>

### <span class="color-sub-step">Step 4.1: Create renderer field</span>

After setting up a text renderer and selecting a font for rendering text, we can now render text on the screen using the
font renderer. To achieve this, you can add the following code to the `OnDraw()` method. Remember to call `IBatcher.Begin()`
before using any `Render()` methods for any renderers, and then call `IBatcher.End()` when you're done with all the renderings.

```csharp
public class Game : Window
{
    ...
    private readonly IFontRenderer fontRenderer; // Renders text
    ...
}
```

### <span class="color-sub-step">Step 4.2: Create renderer</span>

Go into the `OnLoad()` method and create the font renderer. First, we create a renderer factory and then use the factory to create the renderer.

```csharp
protected override void OnLoad()
{
    var rendererFactory = new RendererFactory();
    this.fontRenderer = rendererFactory.CreateFontRenderer();

    base.OnLoad();
}
```

### <span class="color-sub-step">Step 4.3: Create batcher</span>

Create a batcher in the `OnLoad()` method. We can create a batcher using the `rendererFactory`.
We will go over what this is used for later in the guide.

```csharp
protected override void OnLoad()
{
    ...
    this.batcher = rendererFactory.CreateBatcher();

    base.OnLoad();
}
```


### <span class="color-sub-step">Step 4.4: Load the font</span>

Go into the `OnLoad()` method and add the code that loads the font.

```csharp
protected override void OnLoad()
{
    ...
    this.font = ContentLoader.LoadFont("TimesNewRoman-Regular", 24);

    base.OnLoad();
}
```
:::info Built In Fonts
<details><summary>Expand me to learn more!</summary>

Currently, four fonts come _**built-into**_ **Velaptor** and are _**Times New Roman**_.
The 4 different font types are:
- TimesNewRoman-Regular
- TimesNewRoman-Bold
- TimesNewRoman-Italic
- TimesNewRoman-BoldItalic

</details>
:::

### <span class="color-sub-step">Step 4.5: Render the text</span>


Now that we have a text renderer and a font to render text, we need to use the font renderer to render
some text to the screen using our font. Add the code below to the `OnDraw()` method to accomplish
this. Note that we need to invoke `IBatcher.Begin()` before we invoke any `Render()` methods for
any renderers and then invoke the `IBatcher.End()` when we are finished with all of our renderings.

```csharp
protected override void OnDraw(FrameTime frameTime)
{
    this.batcher.Begin();

    this.fontRenderer.Render(this.font, "Hello Velaptor!", 400, 400, Color.White);

    this.batcher.End();

    base.OnDraw(frameTime);
}
```

:::info What is this `IBatcher` thing?
<details><summary>Expand me to learn more!</summary>

As you might have guessed, this is used for batching.  But that does not mean you know what "batching" is right?

Let's fill you in.

Think of a batch as a group of something.  Just like a batch of cookies is a group of cookies, a batch of textures is a group of textures.
What we are doing is making **Velaptor** aware that we will be rendering a bunch of textures.  By rendering textures **together**, we mean
that all of the textures will be sent to the GPU and rendered all together as a group.  Once we are done **rendering**, we then
tell **Velaptor** that we are finished creating our batch and it can now be rendered to the screen.

This is what the `IBatcher` object is used for!!

We tell **Velaptor** that we are ready to start batching by invoking the `IBatcher.Begin()` method.  We then tell **Velaptor** that
we are done batching by invoking the `IBatcher.End()` method.

All of the rendering calls using any of the renderers should go between the `Begin()` and `End()` method calls.

Just remember the steps:
1. Invoke `IBatcher.Begin()` method
2. Invoke all `Render()` methods for the current frame
3. Invoke the `IBatcher.End()` method

That's it!!
</details>
:::

:::info Texture And Text Origin
<details><summary>Expand me to learn more!</summary>

Some game engines and frameworks use the top left corner of an object when rendering at a particular position.
**Velaptor** does not work like that. When rendering text, the position of the text is relative to the center of
the entire text or texture content.

What this means is if you render the text at position _**(0,0)**_, you would only be able to see the bottom right quadrant of the text because
the other 3 quadrants would be rendered off-screen!!  Make sure to take this into account when it comes to text and object render positioning.

</details>
:::

:::caution NOT USING THE BATCHER
If you call a render method with any renderer before the `Begin()` method or after the `End()` method,
you will get an exception!! This is a good thing because you want to know when you are not batching correctly.
:::

### <span class="color-sub-step">Step 4.6: See the result</span>

Now for the best part!! Let's see the fruits of your labor and run the application.
You should see the result below!! ðŸ¥³
<img style={{width: '75%'}} src={require('@site/static/img/tutorials/guides/rendering-text/rendering-text-window.png').default} alt="Example banner"/>


## <span class="color-step">Step 5: Bonus!!!</span>

Now it's time to add some polish to what we just did.  Let's add some color to the text and make it move around the screen.
Better yet, let's move the text around the screen and have it bounce off of the edges of the screen.

Every time the text bounces off the edge of the screen, we can change the color of the text to a random color.

### <span class="color-sub-step">Step 5.1: Class fields</span>

To accomplish the bouncing of the text off the edges of the screen, we need to keep track of the position
and velocity of the text. Also, add the text that will be rendered as a `string const` as a class field as well.

You will see where this comes in later.

Let's add some class fields to store this information.

```csharp
public class Game : Window
{
    ...
    private const string Text = "Hello Velaptor!";
    private Vector2 velocity = new (100, 100);
    private Vector2 position = new (400, 400);
    ...
}
```

### <span class="color-sub-step">Step 5.2:  Screen collision detection</span>

To detect if the text is colliding with the edge of the screen, we need to check if the text is outside of the screen's bounds.
The screen bounds are made up of the four sides of the screen the left, top, right, and bottom. The left and top
locations of the screen are always 0, 0.  This is because the origin of the screen area is the top left corner.

As for the right and bottom locations of the screen, we can get those by using the `Width` and `Height` properties of the `Window` class.

Now that we have enough information about the window that represents the 'world' that the text lives in, we need to get some more information
about the text itself.  The information we need is the width and height of the text.  To get this information, you can use the 'IFont'
content we created in the `OnLoad()` method.

Font objects have a `Measure()` method that returns a `SizeF` type that represents the width and height of the text.

To process all of this information, create a method with the name `ProcessCollisionAndColor()`.  This method will perform both the collision
detection as well as updating the new color of the text on collision.

```csharp
private void ProcessCollisionAndColor()
{
    var textSize = this.font.Measure(Text);
    var halfWidth = textSize.Width / 2;
    var halfHeight = textSize.Height / 2;

    var leftSide = this.position.X - halfWidth;
    var top = this.position.Y - halfHeight;
    var rightSide = this.position.X + halfWidth;
    var bottom = this.position.Y + halfHeight;

    if (leftSide <= 0)
    {
        this.velocity.X *= -1;
    }

    if (top <= 0)
    {
        this.velocity.Y *= -1;
    }

    if (rightSide >= Width)
    {
        this.velocity.X *= -1;
    }

    if (bottom >= Height)
    {
        this.velocity.Y *= -1;
    }
}
```

Looking at the code, you can see how the positions of the sides of the text are calculated.  Since the position of the text is relative to the
center of the text, we need to subtract or add the half or the width and height of the text from the position to get the left, top, right, and bottom.

With this information, we can then use it to compare against the sides of the window.  If a collision occurs, we just flip out `X` or `Y` velocity
by negating it. Negating the velocity is what changes the direction of the text's movement.  This is simple vector math.

### <span class="color-sub-step">Step 5.3: Update position with collision</span>

Now all we have to do is process the collision and update the position of the text.  We can do this in the `OnUpdate()` method.

In the `OnUpdate()` method, add the following.

```csharp
protected override void OnUpdate(FrameTime frameTime)
{
    ProcessCollisionAndColor();
    var displacement = this.velocity * (float)frameTime.ElapsedTime.TotalSeconds;
    this.position += displacement;

    base.OnUpdate(frameTime);
}
```

First, we process any collision and then we just the updated velocity that determines the direction of the text's movement
to help calculate the new position of the text.

:::tip CHANGING THE SPEED
To change the speed of the text, we can change the `X` and `Y` values of the `velocity` vector class field.

Remember, velocity is a representation of 2 things, direction and magnitude.  The larger the numbers, the faster the text will move.
If the number is negative, it will move in the opposite direction of the positive number.
:::

### <span class="color-sub-step">Step 5.4: Changing the color</span>

To change the color, we can use the `Random` class to generate a random color.  
Create 2 more class fields.  One for creating random numbers and one for holding the color of the text.

```csharp
public class Game : Window
{
    ...
    private readonly Random random = new ();
    private Color textColor = Color.White;
    ...
}
```

Let's make a method with the name `RandomizeColor()` that will take care of this so we don't have to duplicate so much code. ðŸ˜‰

```csharp
private void RandomizeColor()
{
    var red = this.random.Next(0, 255); // Create a random red value
    var green = this.random.Next(0, 255); // Create a random green value
    var blue = this.random.Next(0, 255); // Create a random blue value

    // Set the text color
    this.textColor = Color.FromArgb(255, red, green, blue);
}
```

### <span class="color-sub-step">Step 5.5: Update the color</span>

Now that we have our little helper method, we can use it in the `ProcessCollisionAndColor()` method.
Add a call to the `RandomizeColor()` method in each of the `if` statements that check for a collision.

```csharp
private void ProcessCollision()
{
    ...
    if (leftSide <= 0)
    {
        this.velocity.X *= -1;
        RandomizeColor(); // Add this line
    }

    if (top <= 0)
    {
        this.velocity.Y *= -1;
        RandomizeColor(); // Add this line
    }

    if (rightSide >= Width)
    {
        this.velocity.X *= -1;
        RandomizeColor(); // Add this line
    }

    if (bottom >= Height)
    {
        this.velocity.Y *= -1;
        RandomizeColor(); // Add this line
    }
}
```

### <span class="color-sub-step">Step 5.6: Finishing up</span>

Now the exciting part!!  Let's update the `OnDraw()` method to use our `position` and `textColor` class fields.
No point in doing all of this hard work if we can see it.


```csharp
protected override void OnDraw(FrameTime frameTime)
{
    this.batcher.Begin();

    this.fontRenderer.Render(this.font, Text, (int)this.position.X, (int)this.position.Y, this.textColor);

    this.batcher.End();

    base.OnDraw(frameTime);
}
```

The only change to this method is the `Render()` call itself.  We just swapped out our hard-coded text,
X and Y position, and color with the class fields we created.

Now run the application!!

You should see the text bouncing off the edges of the window and with each bounce, the color should change.
