# Rendering With An Atlas Texture

:::note Guide Source Code
Go to the <GuideLink projectName="AtlasTextures" tagName="api-v1.0.0-preview.36"/> guide project to see the source code for a fully working example of this guide.
:::

Another way to render textures is by using an atlas texture. This guide is a little more
in-depth and longer than the previous guides. Stick with it though, it will be worth it!!

An atlas texture is a large image with multiple sub-images packed into a single image. With this single image, you use another file
of a particular format such as JSON or XML, that describes the location, size, and other kinds of attributes for each image in the atlas texture.

When [rendering textures](./rendering-textures) the standard way, you render the entire texture.
Though there is nothing wrong with rendering whole textures one at a time, there are pros and cons. In the end, it all depends on what you are trying to accomplish.

With an atlas texture, you can pack all of the sequences of animation into the atlas. This is usually loaded by a library that loads the atlas texture
and the associated metadata. At this point, it is very easy to automate the process of switching between textures to run an animation. Velaptor comes built-in with loading
atlas textures and their associated metadata.

**Benefits:**

- **Reduces draw calls:** Reduces the number of times Velaptor needs to send data to the GPU and reduces the number of draw calls. Instead of sending data and making draw calls for each texture, you only have to for a single atlas texture.
- **Improved performance:** Reduces draw calls to improve the performance of your game.
- **Easier management:** Easier to manage one large texture than many small ones, especially when it comes to loading and unloading textures and coordinating the draw calls between textures. This result is less code.
- **Smoother Animations:** Makes animations smoother by reducing the amount of time your game spends loading and unloading textures.
- **Reduced memory usage:** Reduces the amount of memory your games use since you only need to load one large texture instead of many smaller ones.

It all depends on your goals. A lot of games use a combination of whole texture and atlas texture rendering.

Various tools out there give you the ability to easily create atlas textures and metadata.  
A couple of examples are: <Url href="www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker" text="Texture Packer" openInNewTab="true"/>
and <Url href="esotericsoftware.com/" text="Spine" openInNewTab="true"/>.

:::note Loading Metadata
Velaptor does not currently have a tool to build these atlas texture images with the associated metadata.
Plans are in the works to add _**Texture Packer**_ integration. One option you have is to create your own
tool to load the _**Texture Packer**_ JSON data for use.  This is not complicated and can get you by
until the _**Texture Packer**_ integration is complete.
:::

:::tip
Do not overstress about whole vs. atlas texture rendering. This comes with practice and depends on your needs.
Keep your needs into account as you develop your game and do not worry about performance until it starts to become an issue.

:::info Atlas Texture Scenario
<details>
	<summary>Expand me for more info!!</summary>

Let's consider a 2D space shooter game with lots of bullets and enemies. In this type of game, there may be a large
number of sprites for the player, the enemies, and the projectiles.
Loading and rendering all of these individually can quickly lead to performance issues due to the large number
of draw calls required.

By using atlas textures, you can pack all of these sprites into a single texture, which can be loaded and rendered
more efficiently. For example, an atlas texture can contain all of the different enemy sprites,
along with their animations and various attack patterns. Similarly, you can create another atlas texture that contains
all of the different bullet sprites, including the various types of projectiles and their associated effects.

By doing this, the game engine can render multiple sprites in a single draw call, significantly improving performance.
Additionally, since all of the sprites are contained within a single atlas texture, there's no need to switch textures
between draw calls, which reduces overhead and leads to smoother gameplay.

Another benefit of using atlas textures is that it can reduce the overall size of the game's asset files.
This is because all of the sprites are packed into a single texture, reducing the amount of duplicated
metadata and overhead that would be required for individual files.

Overall, using atlas textures in a game can improve performance, reduce file size, and lead to smoother gameplay.
</details>
:::

Enough explanation!!  Let's get our hands dirty and build something!!

For this tutorial, we are going to build a simple game that will show a blue animating flame.
This flame will be rendered in the center of the window and will animate in a loop indefinitely.
We will also add a very small amount of randomness to it as well to enhance the animation.


## <span class="color-step">Step 1: Create Project</span>

Create a basic Velaptor application.
:::note Refer To Guide
For more info, refer to the [Project Setup](./project-setup) guide.
:::


## <span class="color-step">Step 2: Get atlas content</span>

Download the atlas texture files below:
- Go <Url href="github.com/KinsonDigital/VelaptorDocs/blob/main/SampleProjects/Guides/AtlasTextures/Content/Atlas/atlas.png" text="here" openInNewTab="true"/> to download the <b><i>atlas.png</i></b> file.
- Go <Url href="github.com/KinsonDigital/VelaptorDocs/blob/main/SampleProjects/Guides/AtlasTextures/Content/Atlas/atlas.json" text="here" openInNewTab="true"/> to download the <b><i>atlas.json</i></b> file.

Click the GitHub download button shown below to download the file
<img style={{width: '20%'}} src={require('@site/static/img/tutorials/guides/rendering-atlas-textures/github-download-btn.jpg').default}/>


## <span class="color-step">Step 3: Add content to project</span>

Add the downloaded atlas texture and metadata JSON file to the ***Content/Atlas/****/ directory in the project.

:::note Refer To Guide
For more info, refer to the [Adding Content](./adding-content) guide.
:::

Both files should be in the same directory and besides the extension, should have the same name.
The two files you downloaded should be named _**atlas.png**_ and _**atlas.json**_.

:::note FILE NAME REQUIREMENTS
You can name the files whatever you want, but the file names, excluding the extensions, must match.
When you load an atlas texture, you will specify the name of the atlas image and metadata and both
files will be loaded at the same time. 
:::

:::caution Warning
If you have an image file with no metadata file or vice versa, Velaptor will throw an exception  
letting you know that _**one**_, the _**other**_, or _**both**_ are missing.
:::

## <span class="color-step">Step 4: Create class fields</span>

Create the following class fields which will be used for holding content data, loading content, manage batching, and rendering content.

```csharp
public class Game : Window
{
    private readonly ITextureRenderer textureRenderer; // Renders textures
    private readonly IBatcher batcher; // Batches the rendering of textures
    private ILoader<IAtlasData>? atlasLoader; // Loads the atlas data
    private AtlasSubTextureData[]? subTextureData; // Holds all of the atlas data
    private IAtlasdata? atlasData;  // The atlas data
}
```

## <span class="color-step">Step 5: Basic setup</span>

In the `Game` class, add the following code to the constructor to set up the window and instantiate the objects mentioned before.

```csharp
public class Game : Window
{
    ...
    public Game()
    {
        Title = "Atlas Textures";
        Width = 500;
        Height = 500;

        this.atlasLoader = ContentLoaderFactory.CreateAtlasLoader(this.batcher);
        this.textureRenderer = RendererFactory.CreateTextureRenderer();
        this.batcher = rendererFactory.CreateBatcher();
    }
}
```


## <span class="color-step">Step 6: Load and unload the content</span>

### <span class="color-sub-step">6.1: Load content</span>

Next, let's create the `OnLoad()` override method and add code to the method to load the atlas data.

```csharp
protected override void OnLoad()
{
    // Loads the atlas.png and atlas.json file
    this.atlasData = this.atlasLoader.Load("atlas");
    this.subTextureData = this.atlasData.GetFrames("flame");

    base.OnLoad();
}
```

The `this.atlasData` class field variable will contain the loaded texture and the metadata for the texture.
We can use this data to make decisions on animation, positioning and more.

:::tip
All you have to provide is the _**name**_ of the atlas. Though you can use the file extension,
it is not required and there is no need to load the _**.png**_ and _**.json**_ files separately
:::

:::info metadata format

<details>
	<summary>Expand me for more info!!</summary>

Let's go over the JSON data that is contained in the metadata file.

_**$type**_: This is the type of object that is used by the JSON serializer to know what type of object to create.  
There is no need to worry about this key. Do not change it and you will be fine.

_**Bounds**_: This is the x, y, width, and height of the sub-texture in the atlas. This is used to determine where
the sub-texture is located in the atlas. These are what you will use during the rendering process to render the frame of the animation.

_**FrameIndex**_: This is the frame number of an animation. If the frame number is -1, then this is not part of an
animation. This is what you will use to keep track of which frame of animation you want to render.

_**Name**_: This is the name of the sub-texture and is what you will use in determining which group of frames animation
you want to load and when calling the `GetFrames()` method. If you wanted to load the metadata for the _**ship**_
sub-texture, you would call `GetFrames("ship")` and you would only get an array with a single item.

```json
{
    "$type": "Velaptor.Graphics.AtlasSubTextureData, Velaptor",
    "Bounds": "1, 846, 403, 948", // The x, y, width, and height of the sub-texture in the atlas
    "FrameIndex": 8, // The frame number of an animation
    "Name": "flame" // The name of the sub-texture
},
{
    "$type": "Velaptor.Graphics.AtlasSubTextureData, Velaptor",
    "Bounds": "428, 850, 361, 948",
    "FrameIndex": 9,
    "Name": "flame"
},
{
    "$type": "Velaptor.Graphics.AtlasSubTextureData, Velaptor",
    "Bounds": "0, 76, 75, 75",
    "FrameIndex": -1, // -1 means that this is not part of an animation
    "Name": "ship"
}
```
</details>
:::

### <span class="color-sub-step">6.2: Unload content</span>

Now we can unload the content when the game shuts down.  This is to clean up resources that are no longer needed.
To do this, we can override the `OnUnload()` method.  We can then call the `Unload()` method on the atlas loader
and send in the `IAtlasData` class field we created earlier.  To do this, we need to add the `Velaptor.ExtensionMethods` namespace
to the top of the file.

Add the following using statement.

```csharp
...
using Velaptor.ExtensionMethods; // Add this line here
...
public class Game : Window
{
    ...
}
```

Now we can override the `OnUnload()` method and unload the font.

```csharp
protected override void OnUnload()
{
    this.atlasLoader.Unload(this.atlasTexture);
    base.OnUnload();
}

```


## <span class="color-step">Step 7: Let's animate</span>

Now that we have loaded the atlas data, let's add some code to the `OnUpdate()` method to animate the sub-textures.

### <span class="color-sub-step">7.1: Tracking time</span>

For us to run an animation, we need to keep track of how much time has passed.
Add the following fields to the `Game` class.

```csharp
public class Game : Window
{
    ...
    private float elapsedMs; // The total milliseconds that have passed
    private int currentFrame; // The current frame of the animation
    private bool isFullSize; // Whether or not the flame has grown to full size
    ...
}
```

:::info WHY?
<details>
	<summary>Expand me for more info!!</summary>

Think of a <Url href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=Un-BdBSOGKY" text="flip book" openInNewTab="true"/>.
If you were to flip through the pages of a flip book, you would see the animation.
The faster you flip through the pages, the faster the animation will appear. The slower you flip
through the pages, the slower the animation will appear. The same concept applies to animations in games.

The problem with software is that it runs each frame very fast. If we changed the frames of the
animation as fast as the game would run, the animation would move too fast. We need to slow down the
animation to the desired speed so that it runs smoothly.

How fast you want to run your animation is up to you. You can make it run as fast or as slow as you want.
</details>
:::

### <span class="color-sub-step">7.2: Has enough time passed?</span>

Add some code to the `OnUpdate()` method to check if enough time has passed to
change the frame of the animation.

```csharp
protected override void OnUpdate(FrameTime frameTime)
{
    this.elapsedMs += (float)frameTime.ElapsedTime.TotalMilliseconds;

    // Move to the next frame every 124ms
    if (this.elapsedMs >= 124)
    {
        // If the current frame is one of the frames after
        // the flame has grown to full size.
        if (this.currentFrame >= 8)
        {
            this.isFullSize = true;
        }

        // Get the starting frame index based on if the flame has
        // grown to full size or not.
        var startFrame = this.isFullSize ? 8 : 0;

        // If the last frame has been reached, reset to the starting frame
        this.currentFrame = this.currentFrame >= this.subTextureData.Length - 1
            ? startFrame
            : this.currentFrame + 1;

        // Reset the elapsed time so we can wait for another
        // 124ms before moving to the next frame
        this.elapsedMs = 0;
    }

    base.OnUpdate(frameTime);
}
```

This code will check if 124ms has passed. If it has, then it will move to the next frame of
the animation. If the last frame has been reached, then it will reset to the first frame.
Now we have our flip book!!

The `startFrame` is the frame where the animation starts, which will be either 0 or 8. If the flame has not grown to
full size, frames 0-7 will be used. If the flame has grown to full size, frames 8-15 will be used.

:::tip
If you want to calculate how many milliseconds it takes for a particular frame rate, just take
the value 1000 and divide it by the desired frame rate.

_**Formula:**_ ms/sec <span style={{fontSize: '14pt', fontWeight: 'bold'}}>÷</span> fps = ms/frame.

For example, 1000 <span style={{fontSize: '14pt', fontWeight: 'bold'}}>÷</span> 60 = 16.66ms. This means if you want to run something at 60fps, you would need to
to make something happen every 16ms to obtain that frame rate.
:::

:::info What is FPS?
<details>
	<summary>Expand me for more info!!</summary>

FPS stands for frames per second, which, as the name implies, is the number of frames that are rendered every second.
The game loop of a game consists of the two most important methods: `OnUpdate()` and `OnRender()`.
The `OnUpdate()` and `OnRender()` methods are called once per frame. The speed (or frequency) at
which these methods are called is what determines the FPS of the game. The faster the methods run,
the higher the FPS.

To calculate the FPS, divide the number of frames rendered by the number of seconds that
a game loop iteration has run. For example, if a game loop iteration runs for 1 second and 60 frames,
then the FPS would be 60. If a game loop iteration runs for 1 second and 30 frames, then the FPS would
be 30.

Since we can keep track of how much time has passed, we can calculate the FPS of the game. We can
take advantage of this time metric coming into the `OnUpdate()` and `OnDraw()` methods to have things
happen at a certain frequency. In this case, the speed at which we want our animation to run.
</details>
:::


## <span class="color-step">Step 8: Render animation</span>

Now we can finally render the animation to the screen. Add the following code to the `OnDraw()` method.

```csharp
protected override void OnDraw(FrameTime frameTime)
{
    // Start the batch
    IBatcher.Begin();

    var x = (int)(Width / 2); // Center of the window horizontally
    var y = (int)(Height / 2); // Center of the window vertically

    // Get the bounds of the sub-texture in the entire atlas at the current frame
    var subBounds = this.subTextureData[this.currentFrame].Bounds;

    // Create the rectangle of where the frame is located in the atlas
    var srcRect = new Rectangle(subBounds.X, subBounds.Y, subBounds.Width, subBounds.Height);

    // Create the rectangle of the entire atlas.
    var destRect = new Rectangle(x, y, (int)this.atlasTexture.Width, (int)this.atlasTexture.Height);

    // Render only the sub-texture in the atlas at the center of the window
    this.textureRenderer.Render(
        this.atlasTexture,
        srcRect,
        destRect,
        0.25f, // Size of the sub-texture
        0f, // Angle of rotation
        Color.White, // Color to tint the sub-texture
        RenderEffects.None,
        1); // Render layer

    // End the batch to render the entire batch
    IBatcher.End();

    base.OnDraw(frameTime);
}
```

Here we are using the location data from the frame metadata to know where in the atlas
the current frame or sub-texture is located. We then render only that sub-texture to the screen.

The `srcRect` and `destRect` variables are what tell Velaptor the _**section**_ of the atlas to render.

## <span class="color-step">Step 9: Run it</span>

Run the game and see the results!  You should see a small window with a blue flame
animating in the center of the window as shown below.

:::note
The animation will be much smoother than what is shown here.
:::

![Flame Animation](@site/static/img/tutorials/guides/rendering-atlas-textures/flame.gif)


## <span class="color-step">Step 10: Bonus!!</span>

You do not have to do this step of course, but what is game development without a little
bit of extra fun?  Let's improve the randomness of the flame animation.

### <span class="color-sub-step">10.1: Add more fields</span>

Add two more class fields to the `Game` class. The `random` field will be used to randomly choose between horizontal
or non-horizontal orientation. The `horizontalLayout` field will be the layout setting at the time of rendering.

```csharp
public class Game: Window
{
    ...
    private readonly Random random = new (); // Chooses random numbers
    private RenderEffects horizontalLayout; // The horizontal orientation to render flame
    ...
}
```

### <span class="color-sub-step">10.2: Add flip behavior</span>

Add the following code to randomly choose whether or not the flame should be flipped horizontally to the
bottom of the `if` block. This will choose a number between the values 0 and 1. If 0 is chosen,
the flame will be flipped horizontally. If 1 is chosen, the flame will not be flipped horizontally.

This is synonymous with flipping a coin.

```csharp
protected override void OnUpdate(FrameTime frameTime)
{
    this.elapsedMs += (float)frameTime.ElapsedTime.TotalMilliseconds;

    // Move to the next frame every 124ms
    if (this.elapsedMs >= 124)
    {
        ...
        // Randomly choose to have the flame flipped horizontally or not flipped at all
        this.horizontalLayout = this.random.Next(0, 2) == 0
            ? RenderEffects.FlipHorizontally
            : RenderEffects.None;
    }

    base.OnUpdate(frameTime);
}
```

### <span class="color-sub-step">10.3: Run it</span>

Now run your game again and the flame will be a little bit more realistic to the randomness of
the orientation of the flame!!
