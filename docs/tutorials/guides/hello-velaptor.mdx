# Hello Velaptor

This guide will show you the basics of creating a simple **Hello World** application using Velaptor.

:::note Guide Source Code
Go to the <TutorialLink projectName="HelloVelaptor" version="v1.0.0-preview.24"/> tutorial project to see the source code for a fully working example of this guide.
:::


## <span class="color-step">Step 1: Create project</span>

Create a basic Velaptor application.
:::note Refer To Guide
For more info, refer to the [Project Setup](./project-setup) guide.
:::


## <span class="color-step">Step 2: Loading content</span>

### <span class="color-sub-step">Step 2.1: Create font field</span>

Create a class field named `font` at the top of the class. This will be the loaded font to use for rendering text.

```csharp
private IFont? font;
```

### <span class="color-sub-step">Step 2.2: Load the font</span>

Now let's load the font using the `ContentLoader` property that belongs to the `Window` class.

```csharp
protected override void OnLoad()
{
    this.font = ContentLoader.LoadFont("TimesNewRoman-Regular", 24); // Loads the font into the class field
    base.OnLoad();
}
```
:::tip content name
The name of the content to load is the same as the content file minus the file extension. You can use or
omit the file extension when using the `ContentLoader.LoadFont()` method. Also, the name is not _**case-sensitive**_.  
Example: The content names _**'my-texture'**_ and _**'My-Texture'**_ are equivalent.
:::

:::caution Warning
Since the name of the content to load is based on the name of the file, renaming the file will break your application!!

## <span class="color-step">Step 3: Rendering text</span>

### <span class="color-sub-step">Step 3.1: Create renderer field</span>

After setting up a text renderer and selecting a font for rendering text, we can now render text on the screen using the
font renderer. To achieve this, you can add the following code to the `OnDraw()` method. Remember to call `IBatcher.Begin()`
before using any `Render()` methods for any renderers, and then call `IBatcher.End()` when you're done with all the renderings.

```csharp
public class Game : Window
{
    ...
    private readonly IFontRenderer fontRenderer; // Renders text
}
```

### <span class="color-sub-step">Step 3.2: Create renderer</span>

Create the font renderer in the constructor. First, we create a renderer factory and then use the factory to create the renderer.

```csharp
public Game()
{
    var rendererFactory = new RendererFactory(); // Create a renderer factory
    this.fontRenderer = rendererFactory.CreateFontRenderer(); // Create a font renderer
}
```

### <span class="color-sub-step">Step 3.3: Create batcher</span>

Create a batcher in the constructor. We can create a batcher using the `rendererFactory`.
We will go over what this is used for later in the guide.

```csharp
public Game()
{
    var rendererFactory = new RendererFactory(); // Create a renderer factory
    this.fontRenderer = rendererFactory.CreateFontRenderer(); // Create a font renderer

    this.batcher = rendererFactory.CreateBatcher(); // Create a batcher
}
```


### <span class="color-sub-step">Step 3.4: Load the font</span>

Go into the `OnLoad()` method and add the code that loads the font.

```csharp
protected override void OnLoad()
{
    this.font = ContentLoader.LoadFont("TimesNewRoman-Regular", 24);

    base.OnLoad();
}
```
:::info Built In Fonts
<details><summary>Expand me to learn more!</summary>

Currently, four fonts come _**built-into**_ Velaptor and are _**Times New Roman**_.
The 4 different font types are:
- TimesNewRoman-Regular
- TimesNewRoman-Bold
- TimesNewRoman-Italic
- TimesNewRoman-BoldItalic

Refer to the [Fonts](./coming-soon/fonts.mdx) guide for more details.

### <span class="color-sub-step">Step 3.5: Render the text</span>


Now that we have a text renderer and a font to render text, we need to use the font renderer to render
some text to the screen using our font. Add the code below to the `OnDraw()` method to accomplish
this. Note that we need to invoke `IBatcher.Begin()` before we invoke any `Render()` methods for
any renderers and then invoke the `IBatcher.End()` when we are finished with all of our renderings.

```csharp
protected override void OnDraw(FrameTime frameTime)
{
    var x = (int)(Width / 2); // Get the center of the window horizontally
    var y = (int)(Height / 2); // Get the center of the window vertically

    IBatcher.Begin(); // This must be called before we invoke render

    // Render the text to the center of the screen with the color orange
    this.fontRenderer.Render(this.font, "Hello Velaptor!!", x, y, Color.Orange);

    IBatcher.End(); // This must be called to end the batching process and render to the screen

    base.OnDraw(frameTime);
}
```

:::info What is this `IBatcher` thing?
<details><summary>Expand me to learn more!</summary>

As you might have guessed, this is used for batching.  But that does not mean you know what "batching" is right?

Let's fill you in.

Think of a batch as a group of something.  Just like a batch of cookies is a group of cookies, a batch of textures is a group of textures.
What we are doing is making **Velaptor** aware that we will be rendering a bunch of textures.  By rendering textures **together**, we mean
that all of the textures will be sent to the GPU and rendered all together as a group.  Once we are done **rendering**, we then
tell **Velaptor** that we are finished creating our batch and it can now be rendered to the screen.

This is what the `IBatcher` object is used for!!

We tell **Velaptor** that we are ready to start batching by invoking the `IBatcher.Begin()` method.  We then tell **Velaptor** that
we are done batching by invoking the `IBatcher.End()` method.

All of the rendering calls using any of the renderers should go between the `Begin()` and `End()` method calls.

Just remember the steps:
1. Invoke `IBatcher.Begin()` method
2. Invoke all `Render()` methods for the current frame
3. Invoke the `IBatcher.End()` method

That's it!!

:::info Texture And Text Origin
<details><summary>Expand me to learn more!</summary>

Some game engines and frameworks use the top left corner of an object when rendering at a particular position.
Velaptor does not work like that. When rendering text, the position of the text is relative to the center of
the entire text or texture content.

What this means is if you render the text at position _**(0,0)**_, you would only be able to see the bottom right quadrant of the text because
the other 3 quadrants would be rendered off-screen!!  Make sure to take this into account when it comes to text and object render positioning.

:::caution NOT USING THE BATCHER
If you call a render method with any renderer before the `Begin()` method or after the `End()` method,
you will get an exception!! This is a good thing because you want to know when you are not batching correctly.

Now for the best part!! Let's see the fruits of your labor and run the application.
You should see the result below!! ðŸ¥³

## <span class="color-step">Step 4: Let's update something</span>

A game isn't a game without behavior and interaction, otherwise, you're just looking at a still picture!
All games have 2 pieces that make up the game loop. The first piece is the ability to update your game before you render it to the screen.
The second piece is rendered on the screen. Let's add something to give the application some life.

### <span class="color-sub-step">Step 4.1: Create fields</span>

Let's change the text to a random color every second. To accomplish this, we need some more class fields to work with.

```csharp
public class Game : Window
{
	...
    private readonly Random random = new(); // Creates random numbers
    private double elapsedMs; // Total amount of time that has passed in milliseconds
	private Color textColor; // Represents the color of the text
}
```

### <span class="color-sub-step">Step 4.2: Create `OnUpdate()` method</span>

To create a random color every second, we need to hook into the update part of the game loop. If an
`OnUpdate()` method does not already exist, create an empty method override of the `Window.OnUpdate()` method.

```csharp
protected override void OnUpdate(FrameTime frameTime)
{
    base.OnUpdate(frameTime);
}
```

### <span class="color-sub-step">Step 4.3: Randomize text color</span>

Add some logic in the `OnUpdate()` method to randomize the text color every second.

```csharp
protected override void OnUpdate(FrameTime frameTime)
{
    // If 1,000 milli-seconds(1 second) has passed
    this.elapsedMS += frameTime.ElapsedTime.TotalMilliseconds;

    // If 1,000 milli-seconds(1 second) has passed
    if (this.elapsedMS >= 1000)
    {
        this.elapsedMS = 0; // Reset back to zero to restart the timer

        var red = this.random.Next(0, 256); // Create a random red value
        var green = this.random.Next(0, 256); // Create a random green value
        var blue = this.random.Next(0, 256); // Create a random blue value

        // Set the text color
        this.textColor = Color.FromArgb(255, red, green, blue);
    }

    base.OnUpdate(frameTime);
}
```

Inside `OnDraw()` method, pass `textColor` variable to the `Render()` method.

```csharp
protected override void OnDraw(FrameTime frameTime)
{
	...
    // Render the text to the center of the screen with the random color
    this.fontRenderer.Render(this.font, "Hello Velaptor!!", x, y, this.textColor);
	...
}
```

## <span class="color-step">Step 5: Run it</span>
Run the application and see the result!!
