# Adding Content

All games need content.  Content is the lifeblood of a game.  Without content, there is no game.  In this section, we will
learn how to add content to our game.

Various types of content can be added to a game.  In this tutorial, we will be adding an image to our game.  This image is what
is loaded and consumed by Velaptor to be converted into a `Texture` object.  Other kinds of content can be added to a game, such as
fonts, sounds, and more.  You can even build custom content loaders to load content types for your game to use.

The default kinds of content supported by Velaptor are:
- PNG images
- OGG audio files
- MP3 audio files
- Atlas texture meta-data files (these are in JSON format)
- Fonts (TTF files)

Below are the steps to add content to your game and is the same process no matter what kind of content you are adding.
The only difference is the folder location you are adding your content to based on the type of content you are adding.

:::info
There are plans in the future to build a content management tool to automate and simplify the process of adding content to a game.
The process laid out below is a process specific to Visual Studio and JetBrains Rider.
:::


### <span class="color-step">Step 1: Create Project</span>

Create a basic Velaptor application.
:::note
For more info, refer to the [Project Setup](./project-setup) guide.
:::


### <span class="color-step">Step 2: Create content folder</span>

Create a content folder based on the type of content being added.


In the solution explorer, add a folder named _**Content**_ to the root of the project, then add a folder named _**Graphics**_ to the _**Content**_ folder.
Once this is complete, download the Velaptor mascot image and put it into the _**./Content/Graphics**_ folder.



<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="vs" label="Visual Studio" default>
        <img style={{width: '70%'}} src={require('@site/static/img/tutorials/guides/rendering-textures/add-texture-vs.gif').default} alt="Example banner"/>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="banana" label="JetBrains Rider">
        <img style={{width: '70%'}} src={require('@site/static/img/tutorials/guides/rendering-textures/add-texture-rider.gif').default} alt="Example banner"/>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info IMPORTANT
In the same location as the running application, the _**Content/Graphics**_ folder is _**required**_ for Velaptor's default content location for graphics file content.
:::


### <span class="color-step">Step 3: Set as content</span>

Now that the image file is added to the project, we can tell our IDE to copy the file and its directory
structure to the build output location of where the application lives.  This will update the
appropriate content directory every time the project is built.  Every time you add another content
item to the project, you will need to follow this same process.

:::note
These copy file features are part of Visual Studio and JetBrains Rider, not of Velaptor.
