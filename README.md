Please refer to the original [Docusaurus Documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs) to learn about how it works and how to get started.

Below are simple steps you will need when contributing.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch with the syntax `feature/<issue-number>-<branch-description>`.
   - Example: feature/123-my-branch
   - Feature branches are created from `main` and are merged back into `main`.
3. Every issue has a pull request.  Make sure that it is ok to work on the issue by contacting a maintainer.
   - You can contact a maintainer in the comments of the issue and in [Discord](https://discord.gg/qewu6fNgv7).  Leaving a comment in the issue is a must so the maintainer can assign the issue to you.
4. Create pull request. Please use [Early Pull Requests](https://medium.com/practical-blend/pull-request-first-f6bb667a9b6)
    - The first commit should be an empty commit with the message of `Start work for issue #<issue-number>`.
    - Please create the pull request in draft. üòÄ
5. Perform your work.  Make sure to test locally!!
6. Take the PR out of draft which will request a review.

## **Common Development Commands**

</span>

### **Install npm packages**

Use the command `pnpm i` or `pnpm install` to install all of the project's dependencies.

### **Serve Build Locally**

Use the command `pnpm serve` to run a local server of the production version of the website.
