# Loading Content

Loading content is a crucial part of any game. The process of loading and unloading content is important
for not only performance by getting the content loaded into memory before it is needed but also for
managing the total memory of the game by unloading the content that is no longer needed.


## <span className="color-step">Types of content</span>

The types of content supported by Velaptor are:

| Content Type | Format Types |
|:--------:|:-----------------------------------:|
| Textures | .png                                |
| Audio    | .ogg, .mp3                          |
| Atlas    | .png with .json                     |
| Fonts    | .ttf                                |

These formats are well-known.  More formats will be added in the future as needed.

## <span className="color-step">Content caching</span>

Caching content is done in Velaptor automatically. This caching helps significantly improve the performance of loading content.
All content types are cached until the content item is unloaded.  If you want to take advantage of a texture that is already loaded and cached and wish to use it in another part of your game, you can do so by not unloading
the content item.

When loading a content item with the same name later, Velaptor will check to see if it is already loaded and cached; if so, it will just use the cached content. The content item does not need to be loaded.

Velaptor uses the file's fully qualified path to identify if the file is cached.

Velaptor can't know when content is needed or not.  Managing the content is put into the hands of the game developer.  The game developer is responsible for loading and unloading content as required.

## <span className="color-step">Content paths</span>

You can use various types of pathing in Velaptor to load content. Depending on the path, Velaptor will automatically determine where the content is located based on whether you are using relative or absolute paths.

### <span className="color-sub-step">Relative paths</span>

By default, Velaptor looks for content in the following locations:

- Graphics: `Content/Graphics`
- Audio: `Content/Audio`
- Atlas: `Content/Atlas`
- Fonts: `Content/Fonts`

When loading content with relative paths, these relative paths are _**relative**_ to the content folder based on its content type.

For example, if you are loading a texture named _**velaptor-logo.png**_, you would use the following path:

```csharp showLineNumbers
const logoPath = "velaptor-logo";

var textureLoader = ContentLoaderFactory.CreateFontLoader();
var mascotTexture = textureLoader.Load(logoPath);
```

Notice that the content item path does not include the relative `Content/Graphics` directory path or the file extension.
Velaptor automatically looks in the `Content/Graphics` directory for the content item because you are using a texture loader, which will save you unnecessary typing.

:::tip Default pathing
Remember, as long as you are using relative file paths, you are telling Velaptor to load the content
in the default content folder for that content type.
:::

### <span className="color-sub-step">Absolute paths</span>

You can also use absolute paths to load content.  Absolute paths give you more control over where you want to put your content.

### <span className="color-sub-step">File extensions</span>

You can include or exclude the file extension when using absolute or relative paths. Not including the file extension tells Velaptor to look for files with the supported formats in a particular order until the file is found.

For example, with audio, you can use _**ogg**_ or _**mp3**_ files.  If you do not include the file extension, Velaptor will
first look for an _**ogg**_ file with the same base file name, and if not found, it will look for an _**mp3**_ file with the same name.  If neither file format exists, then an exception will be thrown.

:::info Auto File Format Loading
The only content type requiring some forethought into multiple formats is audio.
:::

:::tip Never use file extensions
To avoid file extensions, use a different base file name across multiple files with other extensions.  This way, Velaptor will always find the file you want to load.

For example, if you have a sound named _**explosion-1.ogg**_ and _**explosion-2.mp3**_, then you do not need to worry
about using a file extension because the base file names _**explosion-1**_ and _**explosion-2**_ are different and Velaptor
can easily distinguish between the two.

Most of the time, there is no need to worry about file extensions because there is no need for the same base file name.
This feature is for very unique situations.

## <span className="color-step">Loading content</span>

Loading content is very straightforward.  Depending on the type of content format you want to load, you use the appropriate
content loader to load the content and is required to be in the `OnLoad()` method in your game class.

```csharp showLineNumbers
protected override void OnLoad()
{
    // Loading textures
    var textureLoader = ContentLoaderFactory.CreateTextureLoader();
    var texture = textureLoader.Load("velaptor-logo");

    // Loading audio
    var audioLoader = ContentLoaderFactory.CreateAudioLoader();
    var audio = audioLoader.Load("ice-beam");

    // Loading atlas'
    var atlasLoader = ContentLoaderFactory.CreateAtlasLoader();
    var atlas = atlasLoader.Load("level-1-atlas");

    // Loading fonts
    var fontLoader = ContentLoaderFactfory.CreateFontLoader();
    var font = fontLoader.Load("Arial");
}
```

## <span className="color-step">Unloading content</span>

Unloading content is also very straightforward. Depending on your needs, it is essential to keep your memory usage as low as possible.

Do in the `OnUnload()` method.

```csharp showLineNumbers
protected override void OnUnload()
{
    // Unloading textures
    textureLoader.Unload(texture);

    // Unloading audio
    audioLoader.Unload(audio);

    // Unloading atlas'
    atlasLoader.Unload(atlas);

    // Unloading fonts
    fontLoader.Unload(font);
}
```


## <span className="color-step">Cross-platform features</span>

Velaptor is cross-platform and considers the differences between paths on different operating systems.
Windows and POSIX systems such as Linux and MacOS have different pathing conventions.  Window uses backslashes and forward
slashes for pathing, while POSIX systems only use forward slashes.  You can use back or forward slashes in Velaptor, and it
Velaptor will automatically convert all backslashes to cross-platform compatible forward slashes.
