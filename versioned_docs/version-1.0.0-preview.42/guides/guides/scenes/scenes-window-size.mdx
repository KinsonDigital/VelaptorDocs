# Scenes & Window Size

If you want to be able to access the size of the window in your scenes, you can use the `WindowSize` property and
override the `Resize()` method.

This information in games is essential. You can use it to position elements, scale them, understand the bounds of
the game world, check for collisions in 2D space, and more.

Let's cover both.

## <span className="color-step">Window Size property</span>

In any scene that inherits from the `SceneBase` class, you can access a property named `WindowSize`.

Here is a simple example of using the property to get the center of the window.

```csharp showLineNumbers
protected override void OnUpdate(FrameTime frameTime)
{
    var center = new Vector2(WindowSize.Width / 2f, WindowSize.Height / 2f);

    base.OnUpdate(frameTime);
}
```

## <span className="color-step">Resize method override</span>

All scenes inherited from the `SceneBase` class can override a method named `Resize()`. This method is called every time the size of the window
changes. The parameter `size` will contain the new size of the window.

```csharp showLineNumbers
public override void Resize(SizeU size)
{
    this.center = new Vector2(size.Width / 2f, size.Height / 2f);

    base.Resize(size);
}
```

:::info
The method `Resize()` override will not be invoked unless you use _**Velaptor's**_ built-in scene management.
The method will not be invoked unless you add the scene to the `SceneManager`.

If you are manually managing your scenes, that is ok.  Manually invoke the `Resize()` method for each scene
in your `Game` class. Utilize the `OnResize()` method override to invoke your scene's `Resize()` method.
