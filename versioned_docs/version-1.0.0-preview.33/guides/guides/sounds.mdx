Can you imagine playing Mario Brothers games without the **jump** sound effect? How about playing Metroid with no amazing music
and no weapon sound effects?  Sounds are a great way to add some life to your game.  Whether it is background music or sound
effects, Velaptor has you covered.

Check out some of these sounds!! They might bring back memories. ðŸ˜‰

## <span className="color-step">Step 1: Project setup</span>

Create a basic Velaptor application.

:::note Refer To Guide
For more info, refer to the [Project Setup](./project-setup) guide.  
You only need the `OnLoad()` and `OnUpdate()` methods.
:::

## <span className="color-step">Step 2: Create class fields</span>

Create the required class fields that will be used to get the keyboard input, and hold the previous keyboard state for
each loop iteration, load the sound content and hold the loaded sound.

```csharp
public class Game : Window
{
    private ILoader<ISound> soundLoader;
    private IAppInput<KeyboardState> keyboard;
    private ISound? music;
    private KeyboardState prevKeyState;
    ...
}
```

## <span className="color-step">Step 3: Setup window</span>

Let's set up our window to not be so large, create an object to detect keyboard input, and create
create the sound loader to load sound content.

Create a `Game()` constructor and add the following code:

```csharp
public Game()
{
    Title = "Sounds";
    Width = 900;
    Height = 600;

    this.keyboard = HardwareFactory.GetKeyboard();
    this.soundLoader = ContentLoaderFactory.CreateSoundLoader();
}
```


## <span className="color-step">Step 4: Load and unload the content</span>

Now, let's proceed with loading the sound as audio content for playback. Before we delve into the code for loading the
audio content, it's crucial to add the audio file to the project as content. This step ensures it can be loaded.
Once that's finished, we can enhance the functionality by adding code into the `OnLoad()` method. This code will enable
us to load the audio content and create a keyboard input object. By utilizing the keyboard, we'll be able to easily
control the audio playback.

:::info Supported Audio Formats
Currently, the supported audio formats are _**.mp3**_ and _**.ogg**_.
:::

### <span className="color-sub-step">4.1: Get audio content</span>

You can provide whatever audio file you want, but if you don't have one, you can download the original guide project
sound <Url href="github.com/KinsonDigital/VelaptorDocs/raw/api-v1.0.0-preview.32/SampleProjects/Guides/Sounds/Content/Sounds/deep-consistency.ogg" text="here" openInNewTab="true"/>.

Play it to see if you like it.  ðŸ˜€
<Audio url="https://github.com/KinsonDigital/VelaptorDocs/raw/api-v1.0.0-preview.32/SampleProjects/Guides/Sounds/Content/Sounds/deep-consistency.ogg" />

### <span className="color-sub-step">4.2: Setup file as content</span>

We need to add the audio file to the project into a particular directory and then set the file to be copied to the
build output.  This will be the default location where Velaptor will be looking for audio content.

:::note Refer To Guide
For more info, refer to the [Adding Content](./adding-content) guide.
:::

### <span className="color-sub-step">4.3: Load the content</span>

Now that we have the audio file added to the project, we can write some code to load the audio content.
Add the following code to the `OnLoad()` method to load the sound.

```csharp
protected override void OnLoad()
{
    this.music = this.soundLoader.Load("deep-consistency");

    base.OnLoad();
}
```

:::tip Content name
Remember, the name of the audio file _**without its extension**_ will be the name of the content. 
Example: 'deep-consistency.ogg' will become 'deep-consistency'.
:::

### <span className="color-sub-step">4.4: Unload the content</span>

We also need to unload the audio content when the window is closed.  Add the following code to the `OnUnload()` method.

**1.** Add a `using` statement at the top of the file to get access to some content-related extension methods.  Though these are not required,
they make unloading content a bit easier.

```csharp
...
using Velaptor.ExtensionMethods; // Add this line here
...
public class Game : Window
{
    ...
}
```

**2.** Create the `OnUnload()` method and add the following code to unload the audio content.

```csharp
protected override void OnUnload()
{
    this.soundLoader.Unload(this.music);
    base.OnUnload();
}
```

## <span className="color-step">Step 5: Displaying sound info</span>

So we have an audio file to play, but we need to know some information like the current duration of the audio,
if it's playing or paused, and some basic instructions for the user on how to control the audio playback.  Since we are going
to be using the keyboard to control the sound, it makes sense to tell the user which keyboard keys are used to stop, play, and
perform other sound-related operations.

:::info Note Title
In the spirit of keeping things simple, we'll display the information in the title bar of the window.
You could absolutely display the information in the window itself by rendering text.
:::

### <span className="color-sub-step">5.1: Displaying audo state</span>

We'll create a method that will be used to display the information we want in the title bar.  Create the following `UpdateTitle()`
method and add some code to get a string representing the current state of the audio file.

```csharp
private void UpdateTitle()
{
    string state;

    if (this.music.State == SoundState.Stopped)
    {
        state = "Stopped";
    }
    else
    {
        state = this.music.State == SoundState.Playing ? "Playing" : "Paused";
    }
}
```

### <span className="color-sub-step">5.2: Display time and instructions</span>

Now, add the code below the code you added previously added.  This code will get the minutes and seconds of the audio
playback in the correct 2-digit format as well as the instructions for the user on how to play, pause, fast forward,
and rewind the audio.

```csharp
private void UpdateTitle()
{
    ...
    var minutes = (int)this.music.Position.Minutes;
    var seconds = (int)this.music.Position.Seconds;

    var minStr = minutes <= 9 ? $"0{minutes}" : minutes.ToString();
    var secStr = seconds <= 9 ? $"0{seconds}" : seconds.ToString();

    var playTime = $"{minStr}:{secStr}";
    const string instructions = "Instructions: Space(play/pause) Esc(restart) Left(-5s) - Right(+5s)";

    Title = $"{state} - {playTime} | {instructions}";
}
```

Great!  Now we have a method to update useful information about the audio as well as instructions for the user!!


## <span className="color-step">Step 6: Controlling the audio</span>

:::note Refer To Guide
For more info, refer to the [Keyboard Input](./keyboard-input) guide.
:::

We can put this all together so we can control the audio playback but first, we need to inspect the state of the keyboard
to see which key is being pressed.

### <span className="color-sub-step">6.1: Keyboard state & key pressed</span>

To get the current state of the keyboard and to check if any key has been fully pressed, add the code below to the
`OnUpdate()` method. 

```csharp
protected override void OnUpdate(FrameTime frameTime)
{
    var currKeyState = this.keyboard.GetState();

    bool IsPressed(KeyCode key)
    {
        return this.prevKeyState.IsKeyDown(key) && currKeyState.IsKeyUp(key);
    }
}
```

:::tip Local Functions
This code snippet uses a local function to check whether or not a key is pressed, which is a new feature in C# 7.0.  If you are not
familiar with local functions, you can read more about them <Url href="docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/local-functions" text="here" openInNewTab="true"/>.
```csharp
// This is a local function
bool IsPressed(KeyCode key) 
{
    return this.prevKeyState.IsKeyDown(key) && currKeyState.IsKeyUp(key);
}
```
:::

### <span className="color-sub-step">6.2: Audio control with keyboard</span>

This tutorial would be pretty useless if we didn't provide control over the audio for demo and learning purposes, right?ðŸ˜‰
You can make that happen by adding the following code after the local function in the `OnUpdate()` method.

```csharp
protected override void OnUpdate(FrameTime frameTime)
{
    ...
    if (IsPressed(KeyCode.Space))
    {
        if (this.music.State is SoundState.Paused or SoundState.Stopped)
        {
            this.music.Play();
        }
        else
        {
            this.music.Pause();
        }
    }
    else if (IsPressed(KeyCode.Escape))
    {
        this.music.Reset();
    }
    else if (IsPressed(KeyCode.Left))
    {
        this.music.Rewind(5);
    }
    else if (IsPressed(KeyCode.Right))
    {
        this.music.FastForward(5);
    }
}
```

### <span className="color-sub-step">6.3: Finishing up</span>

Now, to finish things up, we can finalize our code by implementing keyboard state tracking for the previous frame, alongside
updating the window title. The significance of the previous keyboard state is important. Without it, we cannot accurately
determine if a key has been pressed. To accomplish this, we must diligently maintain a record of the keyboard's state in
the previous frame and subsequently compare it with the current state. This approach enables us to discern whether a key
has moved from a pressed (down) position to a released (up) position. 

To implement this, simply insert the following code snippet after the `OnUpdate()` method.

```csharp
protected override void OnUpdate(FrameTime frameTime)
{
    ...
    this.prevKeyState = currKeyState;

    UpdateTitle();

    base.OnUpdate(frameTime);
}
```

## <span className="color-step">Step 7: Run it</span>

Run the game and let's play some music!  You should see the following window:

        <img style={{ width: '75%' }} src={require('@site/static/img/tutorials/guides/sounds/sounds-window.png').default} alt="Example banner" />

As the instructions in the title bar state, press the space bar to play and pause the audio, escape to stop or restart the
audio, the left arrow key to rewind 5 seconds, and the right arrow key to fast forward 5 seconds.

Simple!!  Now you can add sound effects and/or music to your games!!
