# Intro to Velaptor

Velaptor is an open-source framework for building high-performant, high-quality, cross-platform 2D games using C#/dotnet.

:::info Framework Vs. Library
[Here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-difference-between-a-framework-and-a-library-bd133054023f/) is a good explanation of a framework vs a library.
:::

## Overview

Velaptor focuses on building your game instead of having to write low-level code. Rendering graphics,
keyboard and mouse input, sound, and other common features required by games can take hours
(trust me, I know). This is where Velaptor can help!!

Now you can just focus on developing your game!!

:::info Quick Note
Velaptor is currently only in preview and under development. You can create games with Velaptor in
its current state to run on Windows. We are constantly adding improvements and there are plans for Velaptor to run on other platforms such as
Linux, Android, and iOS. As of right now, there are no plans to support MacOS.

### Single Codebase

The goal of Velaptor is to be able to write 2D games from a single code base and to run them on multiple platforms.
Now, you don't have to maintain multiple languages and tech stacks to be able to run your game on the desired platforms.

### Performant

Velaptor has been built with performance in mind and we strive for it to be as performant as possible.

### Simple

Creating games can be some of the most complicated and resource-demanding applications out there.
Our goal is to make the process as simple as possible. We are willing to change the API if it
means there is a gain in simplicity while taking performance into account.

### Reliable

We strive to make Velaptor as reliable and free of bugs as possible. We all know that there is no such thing as
100% bug-free software but that does not mean we can't strive for it!!
Velaptor is highly tested with manual testing, a very high level of code coverage and regular testing application and
unit test maintenance to make sure that nothing slips through the cracks.

We have achieved reliability by designing the Velaptor architecture to be loosely coupled as well as making use
of the observable pattern and dependency injection to make the code as testable as possible.

    <summary>A quick note about unit testing</summary>

Unit tests are not the end-all-be-all solution for reliable bug-free software. We do not strive to have
100% code coverage for the goal of having 100% code coverage. There are areas of Velaptor that _**CANNOT**_ be tested
due to some of the low-level interactions with systems and libraries such as [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/), sound,
[FreeType](https://freetype.org/), and other low-level interactions. These pieces are abstracted away to achieve high testability
on the Velaptor side.

This is one reason why we do lots of manual testing to cover the areas that unit tests cannot.
