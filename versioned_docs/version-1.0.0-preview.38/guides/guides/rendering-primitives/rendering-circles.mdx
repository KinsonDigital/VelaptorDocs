# Rendering Circles

:::note Guide Source Code
Go to the <GuideLink projectName="Circles" tagName="api-v1.0.0-preview.36"/> guide project to see the source code for a fully working example of this guide.

This guide will show you only some steps relative to the guide project.  
It will only show you the most essential information related to rendering circles.  
The guide project uses most of the concepts discussed in the previous guides.
:::

Rendering primitive shapes is a fundamental part of game development. Shapes can be used to create custom UI elements for guides, tutorials, and even debug drawing.

What is debug drawing, you ask?

Debug drawing renders shapes to the screen to help you debug your game.  For example, you could draw
a sprites bounding box to help you see where the sprite is on the screen, which can help with debugging
issues with collision detection.

In this guide, you will learn how to render circles to the screen using _**Velaptor**_.

The circle has different attributes you can set to customize how the circle will look.  These attributes
range from position, size, color, and even color gradients.

Let's render some circles!


## <span className="color-step">Creating & Rendering Circles</span>

Creating a circle is just as easy as creating any C# object.  The type to use when creating a circle is
`CircleShape`. The `CircleShape` type is a `record struct`.  Using a `struct` keeps things performant and lightweight.

### <span className="color-sub-step">Creating Empty Circle</span>

Here is an example of creating a circle.

```csharp showLineNumbers
var circle = new CircleShape();
```

The code above will create a circle with all attributes set to default values.  If you were to render this, you would
not see anything. The reason for this would be that we did not set the size of the circle.

Let's give the circle a size by setting the `Radius` property.

```csharp showLineNumbers
var circle = new CircleShape();
// highlight-add-start
circle.Radius = 50;
// highlight-add-end
```

### <span className="color-sub-step">Rendering The Circle</span>

To render the circle, we must create an `IShapeRenderer` renderer.

```csharp showLineNumbers
public Game()
{
    // If you are rendering from a `Game` class, make sure you have a batcher
    this.batcher = RendererFactory.CreateBatcher();
    this.shapeRenderer = RendererFactory.CreateShapeRenderer();
}
```

Now that we have the renderer, we can render the circle to the screen.
Add the code below to an `OnDraw()` lifecycle method in your `Game` or scene class.

```csharp showLineNumbers
protected void OnDraw(FrameTime frameTime)
{
    IBatcher.Begin();

    this.shapeRenderer.Render(circle);

    IBatcher.End();
}
```

You should end up with a circle that looks like the image below.

<div className="flex flex-row space-x-10 justify-center items-center app-win">
    <div className="mt-7">
    ![rendered-circle](./images/rendered-white-circle.png)
    </div>
</div>

## <span className="color-step">Rectangle Color</span>

Setting the color of the circle involves setting the `Color` property. This uses the `System.Drawing.Color` struct that is built
right into dotnet.

```csharp showLineNumbers
var rect = new RectShape();
rect.Color = Color.RoyalBlue;
```

This should give you a rectangle that looks like the image below.

<div className="flex flex-row space-x-10 justify-center items-center app-win">
    <div className="mt-7">
    ![rendered-circle](./images/rendered-blue-circle.png)
    </div>
</div>

## <span className="color-step">Circle Size</span>

You can set the size of the circle using the `Radius` or `Diameter` properties.  These properties are of type `float`
for precision.

```csharp showLineNumbers
var circle = new CircleShape();
// highlight-add-start
circle.Diameter = 100;
// highlight-add-end
```

:::note RADIUS VS DIAMETER
Changing the value of both properties will affect the other.  
Remember, the `Diameter` of a circle is twice the size of the `Radius`.
:::

## <span className="color-step">Circle Position</span>

Dealing with the position of the circle is straightforward.  You can set the position of the circle by using the following properties:

1. `Position`
2. `Top`
3. `Bottom`
4. `Left`
5. `Right`

Changing the values of the properties above will affect the other property values.
For example, let's say your circle was at the position of (10, 20) and the size was (100, 200).

If you were to move the circle to the right by **30** pixels using the 'Left' property, then
the value of the `Right` property would be **130**.

The result is that it makes circle positioning easy to work with.  Your code will also be more readable and maintainable because
you can use the property that makes the most sense for the situation and the rest of your code.

Check out the code below:

```csharp showLineNumbers
var circle = new CircleShape();

circle.Radius = 5; // or circle.Diameter = 10;

circle.Position = new Vector2(100, 200);

/* Starting Positions:
 * Left: 95
 * Right: 105
 * Top: 195
 * Bottom: 205
*/

circle.Left += 2;

/* Positions After Moving Left:
 * Left: 97
 * Right: 107
 * Top: 190
 * Bottom: 210
*/

circle.Top += 2;

/* Positions After Moving Down:
 * Left: 95
 * Right: 105
 * Top: 197
 * Bottom: 207
*/

circle.Radius += 10;

/* Positions After Increasing Radius (or diameter by 5):
 * Left: 985
 * Right: 115
 * Top: 185
 * Bottom: 215
*/
```

:::note NOTE ABOUT POSITIONING
The `Position` of a `CircleShape` is relative to the center of the circle.  
Not the top left corner of the bounding box of the circle.
:::

Did you notice that the `Radius` or `Diameter` properties changed the values of the `Left`, `Right`, `Top`, and `Bottom` properties?

Since the position of the circle is relative to the center of the circle, changing the value of the `Radius` or `Diameter` of the
circle will affect the position of the sides of the circle.


## <span className="color-step">Solid & Empty Circles</span>

You can render circles as solid or empty by setting the `IsSolid` property to `true` or `false`.

Here is an example of how to create a solid or empty circle:

```csharp showLineNumbers
var circle = new CircleShape(); // My default is solid

circle.IsSolid = false; // I am not solid
circle.IsSolid = true; // I am solid again
```

## <span className="color-step">Border Thickness</span>

When it comes to the border thickness, it is only visible when the circle is not solid.
The border thickness is set using the `BorderThickness` property and is of type `float`.

Refer to the code below to see how to set the border thickness.

```csharp showLineNumbers
var circle = new CircleShape();
circle.Radius = 50;

circle.IsSolid = false;
circle.BorderThickness = 25;
```

Using the settings above, this is what your circle would look like.

<div className="flex flex-row space-x-10 justify-center items-center app-win">
    <div className="mt-7">
        ![border-thickness](./images/circle-border-thickness.png)
    </div>
</div>


## <span className="color-step">Color Gradients</span>

You can apply color gradients to the circle, which can come in two types.
Apply the gradient type by setting the `GradientType` property to either `GradientType.Horizontal` or `GradientType.Vertical`.

These gradients will transition from one color to another using the `GradientStart` and `GradientStop` properties.

The code below shows you how you could have a horizontal color gradient that would transition from  
<ClrText text="Color.MediumSeaGreen" foreColor="MediumSeaGreen"/> to <ClrText text="Color.MediumPurple" foreColor="MediumPurple"/>,
and a vertical color gradient that would transition from <ClrText text="Color.Teal" foreColor="Teal"/> to <ClrText text="Color.DarkOrange" foreColor="DarkOrange"/>.

```csharp showLineNumbers
var hGradCircle = new CircleShape();
// Horizontal gradient circle
hGradCircle.GradientType = GradientType.Horizontal;
hGradCircle.GradientStart = Color.MediumSeaGreen;
hGradCircle.GradientStop = Color.MediumPurple;

// Vertical gradient circle
var vGradCircle = new CircleShape();
vGradCircle.GradientType = GradientType.Vertical;
vGradCircle.GradientStart = Color.Teal;
vGradCircle.GradientStop = Color.DarkOrange;
```

This would end with the result shown below.

<div className="flex flex-row space-x-10 justify-center items-center app-win mb-10">
    <div className="mt-7">
        ![horizontal-gradient](./images/circle-horizontal-gradient.png)
        ![vertical-gradient](./images/circle-vertical-gradient.png)
    </div>
</div>

:::note GRADIENTS WHEN SET TO NONE
Even if you have the `GradientStart` and `GradientStop` properties set, if the `GradientType` is set to `GradientType.None`,
the gradient will not be rendered, and the circle will be rendered using the `Color` property.
