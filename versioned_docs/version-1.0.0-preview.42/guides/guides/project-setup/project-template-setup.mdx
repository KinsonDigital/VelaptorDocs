# Quick Project Setup Using Template

Using a project template is the fastest and most recommended approach to creating a Velaptor project. This guide will demonstrate how to use the dotnet CLI tool to create a Velaptor project, similar to creating other types of .NET projects with built-in templates.

If you are already familiar with the dotnet CLI tool, creating a project using a template will be straightforward.

The dotnet CLI tool comes with the dotnet SDK. If you already have the dotnet SDK installed, skip this step.


## <span className="color-step">Step 2: Install Velaptor Project Templates</span>

To install the latest version of the Velaptor project templates, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
dotnet new install KinsonDigital.VelaptorTemplates
```

:::tip Installing a Specific Version
If you prefer to install a specific version of the templates, use the command below, replacing `1.0.0` with your desired version number:

```bash
dotnet new install KinsonDigital.VelaptorTemplates::1.0.0
```

To uninstall the project templates, execute the following command:

```bash
dotnet new uninstall KinsonDigital.VelaptorTemplates
```

## <span className="color-step">Step 3: Create Velaptor Project</span>

With the project templates installed, you can easily create a Velaptor project. To see a list of Velaptor projects that you can create, run the following command:

```bash
dotnet new details KinsonDigital.VelaptorTemplates
```

You will receive a list of short names that you can use to create your project. To create a simple, empty project, run the following command:

```bash
dotnet new VelEmpty --name MyVelaptorProject
```

That's it! You now have a Velaptor project created using a project template.
