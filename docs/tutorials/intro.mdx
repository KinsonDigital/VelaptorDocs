# Intro to Velaptor

Velaptor is an open-source framework for building high-performant, high-quality, cross-platform 2D games using C#/dotnet.

:::info
[Here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-difference-between-a-framework-and-a-library-bd133054023f/) is a good explanation of a framework vs a library.

## Overview

Velaptor focuses on building your game instead of having to write low-level code. Rendering graphics, keyboard and mouse input, sound, and other common things
required by games can take hours (trust me, I know). With Velaptor, you can just focus on developing your game!!

Writing these things from scratch can take hours when all you want to do is create.  This is where Velaptor can help!!

:::info Quick Note
Velaptor is currently only in preview and under development.  You can create games with Velaptor in
its current state to run on Windows.  We are constantly adding improvements and there are plans for Velaptor to run on other platforms such as
Linux, Android, and iOS. As of right now, there are no plans to support MacOS.

### Single Codebase

The goal of Velaptor is to be able to write 2D games from a single code base and to run them on multiple platforms.
Now, you don't have to maintain multiple languages and tech stacks to be able to run your game on the desired platforms.

### Performant

Velaptor has been built with performance in mind as much as possible and we will always strive to be as performant as possible.

### Simple

Creating games can be some of the most complicated and resource-demanding applications out there.  Our goal is to try and make
the process as simple as possible.  We are willing to change the API if it means there is a gain in simplicity while taking performance into account.

### Reliable

We strive to make Velaptor as reliable and free of bugs as possible.  We all know that there is no such thing as
100% bug-free software but that does not mean we can't strive for it!!
Velaptor is highly tested.  We maintain a very high level of code coverage to make sure that nothing slips through
the cracks. In addition, we are always maintaining and improving our unit tests.

We have achieved reliability by designing the Velaptor architecture to be loosely coupled as well as making use of the observable
pattern and dependency injection to make the code as testable as possible.

Manual testing is also performed using a custom testing application that is regularly maintained to catch anything
that unit tests do not catch.

:::note A quick note about unit testing
Unit tests are not the end-all-be-all solution for reliable bug-free software.  We do not strive to have
100% code coverage for the goal of having 100% code coverage.  There are areas of Velaptor that _**CANNOT**_ be tested
due to some of the interaction with low-level pieces of the framework such as [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/), sound,
and other low-level operating system interactions.  These pieces are abstracted away to achieve high testability
on the Velaptor side.

This is one reason why we do lots of manual testing to cover the areas that unit tests cannot.

## Learn how to contribute

The Velaptor project is run and maintained by [Calvin Wilkinson](https://twitter.com/KDCoder) and [Kristen Wilkinson](https://twitter.com/kswilky).  We work on this full-time
and work hard to make this project as well as all of the [KinsonDigital](https://github.com/KinsonDigital) projects in working order.  Any open-source developer will tell you
that maintaining open-source projects are a ton of work.🥱
