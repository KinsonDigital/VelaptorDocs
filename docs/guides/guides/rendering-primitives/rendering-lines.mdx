# Rendering Lines

:::note Guide Source Code
Go to the <GuideLink projectName="Lines" tagName="api-v1.0.0-preview.36"/> guide project to see the source code for a fully working example of this guide.

This guide will show you only some steps relative to the guide project.  
It will only show you the essential information related to rendering lines.  
The guide project uses most of the concepts discussed in the previous guides.

Creating lines is very easy! There are only four settings that you need to worry about, and they are:
1. The starting point
2. The ending point
3. The color of the line
4. The line thickness.

## <span className="color-step">Creating & Rendering Lines </span>

Creating a line is just as easy as creating any C# object.  The type to use when creating a line is
`Line` and this keeps things performant and lightweight.

### <span className="color-sub-step">Creating Empty Lines</span>

Here is an example of creating a line.

```csharp showLineNumbers
var line = new Line();
```

The code above will create a line with all attributes set to default values.

### <span className="color-sub-step">Start & End Points</span>

Let's give the line a start and end point. We can do this by setting the `P1` and `P2` properties of the line.
The property `P1` is the start point of the line, and `P2` is the endpoint of the line.

The code below would create a line starting at `(100, 100)` and ending at `(200, 200)`, making a 45Â° diagonal line.

```csharp showLineNumbers
var line = new Line();

line.P1 = new Vector2(100, 100);
line.P2 = new Vector2(200, 200);
```

### <span className="color-sub-step">Rendering The Line</span>

To render the line, we must create an `ILineRenderer` renderer.

```csharp showLineNumbers
public Game()
{
    // If you are rendering from a `Game` class, make sure you have a batcher
    this.batcher = RendererFactory.CreateBatcher();
    this.lineRenderer = RendererFactory.CreateLineRenderer();
}
```

Now that we have the renderer, we can render the line to the screen.
Add the code below to an `OnDraw()` lifecycle method in your `Game` or scene class.

```csharp showLineNumbers
protected void OnDraw(FrameTime frameTime)
{
    IBatcher.Begin();

    this.lineRenderer.Render(line);

    IBatcher.End();
}
```

If you created what was described above, you should end up with a line that looks like the image below.

<div className="flex flex-row space-x-10 justify-center items-center app-win">
    <div className="mt-7">
        ![line](./images/white-line.png)
    </div>
</div>

<br/>

You can also render a line without creating a `Line` object.  It requires using one
of the `ILineRenderer.RenderLine` method overloads.

```csharp showLineNumbers
this.lineRenderer.RenderLine(new Vector2(10, 20), new Vector2(30, 40));

// or

this.lineRenderer.RenderLine(new Vector2(10, 20), new Vector2(30, 40), 14);

// or

this.lineRenderer.RenderLine(new Vector2(10, 20), new Vector2(30, 40), Color.MediumSeaGreen);

// or

this.lineRenderer.RenderLine(new Vector2(10, 20), new Vector2(30, 40), Color.MediumSeaGreen, 14);
```


## <span className="color-step">Rectangle Color</span>

To set the color of the line, set the `Color` property to the desired color.

```csharp showLineNumbers
var line = new Line();
line.Color = Color.MediumPurple;
```

You should end up with a line that looks like the image below.

<div className="flex flex-row space-x-10 justify-center items-center app-win">
    <div className="mt-7">
        ![line](./images/purple-line.png)
    </div>
</div>

## <span className="color-step">Line Thickness</span>

You can also set the thickness of the line in pixels.  The smallest the thickness can be is 1 pixel.
Set the `Thickness` property to the desired value.

```csharp showLineNumbers
var line = new Line();
line.Color = Color.DarkOrange;
line.Thickness = 15;
```

Using the settings above, this is what your line would look like.

<div className="flex flex-row space-x-10 justify-center items-center app-win">
    <div className="mt-7">
        ![line](./images/orange-line.png)
    </div>
</div>
