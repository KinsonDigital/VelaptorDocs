# Adding Content

Content is the lifeblood of a game; without it, there is no game. In this section, we will
learn how to add content to our game.

Various types of content can be added to a game. In this tutorial, we will be adding an image to our game which will be loaded and consumed by Velaptor and converted into a `Texture` object. Other content such as fonts and sounds can also be added. You can even build custom content loaders to load other types of content for your game.
The types of content supported by Velaptor are:
- PNG images
- OGG audio files
- MP3 audio files
- Atlas texture metadata files (these are in JSON format)
- Fonts (TTF files)

Below are the steps to add content to your game. The steps are the same, no matter what kind of content you are adding;
the only difference is the folder location.

:::note Future Plans
There are plans in the future to improve how content is managed as well as support more file formats.
The process laid out below is a process specific to Visual Studio and JetBrains Rider.
:::


## <span class="color-step">Step 1: Create Project</span>

Create a basic Velaptor application.
:::note Refer To Guide
For more info, refer to the [Project Setup](./project-setup) guide.
:::


## <span class="color-step">Step 2: Create content folder</span>

Create a content folder based on the type of content being added.


In the solution explorer, add a folder named _**Content**_ to the root of the project, then add a folder named _**Graphics**_ to the _**Content**_ folder.
Once this is complete, download the Velaptor mascot image and put it into the _**./Content/Graphics**_ folder.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="vs" label="Visual Studio" default>
        <img style={{width: '70%'}} src={require('@site/static/img/tutorials/guides/rendering-textures/add-texture-vs.gif').default} alt="Example banner"/>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="banana" label="JetBrains Rider">
        <img style={{width: '70%'}} src={require('@site/static/img/tutorials/guides/rendering-textures/add-texture-rider.gif').default} alt="Example banner"/>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info IMPORTANT
In the same location as the running application, the _**Content/Graphics**_ folder is _**required**_ for Velaptor's default content location for graphics file content.  
The default fold names for each type of content are:
1. _**Graphics:**_ _Content/Graphics_
2. _**Texture Atlas:**_ _Content/Atlas_
3. _**Audio:**_ _Content/Audio_
:::


## <span class="color-step">Step 3: Set as content</span>

Now that the image file is added to the project, we can tell our IDE to copy the file and its directory
structure to the build output location. This will update the appropriate content directory every time the
project is built. Every time you add another content item to the project, you will need to follow this same process.

:::note Note about IDEs
These copy file features are part of <Url href="visualstudio.microsoft.com/" text="Visual Studio" openInNewTab="true"/> and
<Url href="www.jetbrains.com/rider/" text="JetBrains Rider" openInNewTab="true"/>, not of Velaptor.
